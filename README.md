# What is it ?

It's a *keyboard*, *keypad*, *macropad*, *streamdeck*, wathever you want it to be. 
Accurately, it's a printed circuit board with switches you can use to do actions on your PC.

You are a *streamer*, *developer*, *graphist*, or just someone interested in having shortcuts outside your main keyboard ? 
This is **exactly for you**.

Just plug it and feel free to bind all keystrokes to your favorite software.

You are a geek and you want the same homemade stuff, by yourself ? You can do it !

Here on Github you have the code and all the assets (PCB, 3D Stl). But actually the more important for me was the process : ðŸ˜‰ 
Check out the blog page or the presentation to understand it all !

# Assets

Speaking of recreate it, all I created is free and available !
